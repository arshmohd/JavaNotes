# [Java Notes](http://java.ramswaroop.me)

My Java notes jotted down from some of the best books in Java __(OCJP Java, Thinking in Java,
Effective Java, Java Puzzlers and of course JLS)__ and published as a blog with the help of awesome
__Github's Jekyll__.

It attempts to demystify some of the most misunderstood concepts in **Java** which may confound
even many experienced java programmers.

This blog may not be the best for greenhorns(new learners) but may be worth a read for others, who
can **contribute** too by simply sending in a pull request.

After completing this if you want to get your hands dirty then do try to solve some problems involving various
[algorithms and data structures, in Java](https://github.com/ramswaroop/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-in-Java).
